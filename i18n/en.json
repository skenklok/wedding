          "ceremonyDesc": "The Trafalgar Tavern, located at Park Row, Greenwich, London, SE10 9NW, is a historic riverside pub with a rich and storied past. Built in 1837 by architect Joseph Kay, it stands on the site of the Old George Tavern and quickly became a fashionable destination in Victorian London. The tavern was a popular haunt for notable figures such as Charles Dickens, who set the wedding breakfast in his novel Our Mutual Friend in its Hawke Room, and it hosted political whitebait dinners for the Liberal party in the 19th century.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the building served various purposes, including as a home for aged seamen and a working men's club, before reopening as a pub in 1965. It was restored to its Victorian grandeur in 1968 and designated a Grade II listed building in 1973. Today, the Trafalgar Tavern retains its historical charm with elegant interiors, maritime-themed artworks, and stunning views of the River Thames, making it a unique and picturesque venue for weddings and other celebrations.\n\nWe chose the Trafalgar Tavern as our wedding location because we admire the beauty of the pub. It has been our go-to place for weekends, Sunday roasts, and is like a church to us—being sarcastic, of course. We have celebrated birthdays, Christmases, and witnessed several weddings here until we decided there's no better place for us to host our wedding. We look forward to sharing this friendly, informal setting with our loved ones and ensuring everyone gets immersed in the 'Trafalgar experience'.",
